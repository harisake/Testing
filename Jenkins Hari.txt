----------> jenkins is an execution tool 
jenkins we are using only execution purpose
jenkins we use for scheduling purpose 

in the jenkins Dashboard
==>Configuration
==> build Triggers 
===> build periodically you have to check and select ===> have to pass time and date

H**** every hour
H/20**** every 20 min

in the 
Post-build Actions 
===> you have to select Email notification 
===> have to configure email address 
save and apply

while running jenkins also we will give pom.xml
so you have to create one text.xml file 
and create testng and runner file link created
but pom.xml and testng.xml there is no link 
for that purpose only we will use maven surefile plugin  in the pom.xml file

so indirectly runner file and pom.xml file linked with testng.xml file 

the main purpose of maven sure file plugin 
if you want to call testng.xml file to  integrate with pom.xml 
inside the testng xml file i am calling runner file
now if i execute in the same cmd prmt 
it will open the browser and do all the works 

we are following the BDD framework model 
inside the pom.xml file we are using maven sure file plugin
we are calling the test runner file 
we are using jenkins for our regression automation testing 
what ever the tags we are calling in side the test runner file 
that will be executed
the same thing we are executing with jenkins 
it will take code from our master branch
we can schedule without human interation
we can send all reports to emails
from git only it will take code bcz in the team everyone will push the code
